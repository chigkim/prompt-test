# Prompt Test Instructions

Modify `test.py` and update the following paths as needed:

```python
llama_cli_path = "../llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-cli"
model_path = "../models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf"
```

### Optimize Performance on Mac

For some Mac models, High Power mode is available to prevent performance throttling. Without this, speed results may fluctuate significantly. To enable high-power mode:

1. Open System Settings > Battery.  
2. Under "Energy Mode" for "On Power Adapter," select High Power.

### Adjust GPU Memory Allocation

By default, macOS limits GPU memory usage to 2/3 or 3/4 of total system memory depending your model. To increase this limit, run the following command in the terminal before executing the script:

```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=57344
```

For a 64GB system, this allows the GPU to use up to 56GB, leaving 8GB for other processes.

Calculation: (64GB - 8GB) Ã— 1024MB = **57344MB**  

The setting will be persistent until next reboot.
